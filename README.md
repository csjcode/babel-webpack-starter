# babel-webpack-starter
Experimenting with Webpack-Babel

notes from Traversy Media video on youtube

* `npm init`
* In `package.json` we need to install a few more modules
* `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env`
* Create config file: `webpack.config.js`
* Add script in package.json:
```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build":"webpack"
  },
```
* What this does is when we are ready to compile our javascript we can just say "build"
* We use the configfile to cite the source file and output
* Start off in webpack.config.js with:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: {
        app: '.src/app.js'
    }
}
```

* This tells webpack the source file directory path
* Now after that entry block for the output file path and filename, and module where we define our loaders:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: {
        app: './src/app.js'
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname,'build'),
        filename: 'app.bundle.js',
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [{
            test: /\.js?$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            query: {
                presets: ['env']
            }
        }]
    }
}

```

* Note: regular expr `test: /\.js?$/` to process all .js files, 
* Exclude node_modules folder
* Loader: we're using babel
* query presets - we are using the babel env preset
* create new folder called `src` and inside the file `app.js`
* In app.js: `let test = () => console.log('hi');`
* So now we want to compile this.
* `npm run build`

Result:

```
Version: webpack 3.9.1
Time: 832ms
        Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
app.bundle.js  2.57 kB       0  [emitted]  app
   [0] ./src/app.js 74 bytes {0} [built]
```

* If you look in `app.bundle.js` fiel that was created you are going to see a transpilation from ES6 to ES5 at the bottom of the file:

```
"use strict";


var test = function test() {
  return console.log('hi');
};
```

* Create an `index.html` file in root
* At the bottom of the index.html `<script src="./build/app.bundle.js">`
* Now in app.js add a line to `test();`
* `npm run build`
* Now look at index.html in a browser and the console should display "hi"

* Now we can simplify this with Hot Module Reloading
* Create a new script to run in `package.json` called `"start":"webpack-dev-server --output-public-path=/build/"`
* `npm start`
* You can now make HMR updated changes in app.js - it will be reloaded
* The reason we are doing all this is to use different modules
* Create a file `lib.js` and :

```
export const person = {
    name:"John Doe",
    location:"Miami",
    age:30
}
```

* Now in app.js:

```
import { person } from './lib';

alert(person.city + ' ' + person.city);
```

* back in lib.js we can add a function:

```
export function sayHello(name){
    return `Hi ${name}`;
}
```

* and in app.js:

```
import { person, sayHello } from './lib';

alert(sayHello('Chris'));
```

* Next we are going over a new feature called async/await and add to app.js:

```
async function getPosts(params) {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}

getPosts().then(posts=> console.log(posts));
```
* This by itself gives us an error - regenerator runtime undefined
* To fix this we use the Babel polyfill
* `npm install --save-dev babel-polyfill babel-preset-stage-0 `
* Now in webpack.config we want to add `'babel-polyfill',`:

```
    entry: {
        app: ['babel-polyfill','./src/app.js']
    },
```

* And in presets add stage-0-preset `presets: ['env','stage-0']`

* This should give us some objects in the console when we visit our page at http://localhost:8080/.

```
Array [ Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 
Object, Object, Object, 90 moreâ€¦ ]
```
This script can be used to transpile ES2017 asyn/await code to ES2015 for older browsers.

This can be used to fetch JSON and RSS data.

That's it.
